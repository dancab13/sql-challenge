Materials for the SQL Module 9 challenge for the BCS Data Analytics boot camp

The materials for this challenge include three .sql files: 
-one with the table schema (and relevant other code, like DROP TABLE code)
-one with the queries
-one combined file that contains all of the code

Also included in the repo and below is an ERD created using QuickDBD. The diagram shows the relationships between the tables and notes primary and foreign keys of the tables.

The code is my own that I learned from class. I used the Xpert Learning Assistant for some sanity checks and minor help.
